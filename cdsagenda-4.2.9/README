CDS Agenda Software () is a software developed by,
maintained by, and used at, the CERN Document Server.  It enables you
to create and manage your own online library of conferences. It also
includes several useful features for managing a conference or a simple
meeting.

The CDS Agenda Software is free software licenced under terms of GNU General
Public Licence (GPL).  It is provided on an "as is" basis.  However,
please note that a support contract can be arranged with the CDS
Development Group in which we, the developers, can help you to
install, configure, and maintain the system (featuring email and
telnet support throughout the year), including development of new
local features should a need arise.  If you are interested in
concluding a support contract with us, please contact the CDS
Development Group at <cds.support@cern.ch>.

The CDS software runs on top of MySQL database server and Apache/PHP
web application server.  To install the CDS Software, please consult
the INSTALL file.

Good luck, and thanks for choosing the CDS Agenda Software.
