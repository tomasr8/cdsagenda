0. Prerequisites
================

   Here is the software you need to have around before you
   start installing :

     a) Apache server, compiled with PHP (with --with-imap and --with-ldap
        options if IMAP and LDAP are to be used) and MySQL support:
          <http://httpd.apache.org/>
          <http://www.php.net/>

     b) PHP compiled as standalone command-line executable is required too:
          <http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.commandline.php>

     c) MySQL server (may be on a remote machine), and MySQL client
        (must be available locally too):
          <http://mysql.com/>

     d) JavaTM 2 Platform
	  <http://java.sun.com/>

   (Note that the configure script checks whether you have all
   the prerequisite software installed and that it won't let
   you to continue unless everything is in order.
   Also the PHP version should be newer than 4.1)

2. Detailed instructions for the patient  admin
======================================================

   The CDS Agenda Software uses standard GNU autoconf
   method to build and install its files.  This means that you proceed
   as follows:

      $ mysql -h sqlserver.domain.com -u root -p mysql
          mysql> CREATE DATABASE cdsagenda;
          mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON cdsagenda.* TO cdsagenda@webserver.domain.com IDENTIFIED BY 'myp1ss';
        
          You need to create a dedicated database on your MySQL server
          that the CDS Agenda can use for its purposes.  Please
          contact your MySQL administrator and ask him to execute the
          above commands that will create the "cdsagenda" database, a
          user called "cdsagenda" with password "myp1ss", and that will
          grant all rights on the "cdsagenda" database to the "cdsagenda"
          user.

          (Of course, you are free to choose your own user credentials
           and the database name; the above values were just an
           example.  See also the configure line below.)

      $ sudo vi /path/to/apache/conf/httpd.conf

          Please ask your webserver administrator to put the following
          lines in your "httpd.conf" configuration file:

              AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .shtml
              AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps .shtmls
              DirectoryIndex index.shtml index.php index.html

          This is to ensure that "*.shtml" files will be interpreted
          by the web server as PHP files, and that "index.shtml" will
          be considered as directory index file.

      $ sudo vi /path/to/php/conf/php.ini

          Please ask your webserver administrator to put the following
          lines in your "php.ini" configuration file:
          
	      file_uploads = On
              session.save_handler = user
              session.auto_start = 0
              session.name = SESSIONID
              session.gc_probability = 0
              session.gc_maxlifetime = 60000
              session.cookie_lifetime = 0
              log_errors = on
              display_errors = off
              expose_php = off
              max_execution_time = 160
	      register_globals = on
	      short_open_tag = on

          This is to tell PHP that we will be using our own session
          handler and our own garbage collector.  Also, it sets up
          some other relevant PHP variables.
           
      $ sudo /path/to/apache/bin/apachectl graceful

          Please ask your webserver admin to restart the Apache server
          after the above "httpd.conf" and "php.ini" changes.

      $ cd /usr/local/src/
 
          Change to a directory where we will configure and build the
          CDS Agenda Software.  (The built files will be installed later on
          into Apache htdocs and cgi-bin trees.)

      $ wget http://cdsware.cern.ch/cdsagenda/download/cdsagenda-4.2.tar.gz

          Fetch package from the  distribution server.

      $ tar xvfz cdsagenda-4.2.tar.gz

          Untar the distriburion tarball.    

      $ cd cdsagenda-4.2
   
          Go to the source directory.

      $ ./configure --with-htdocsdir=/www/data/cdsagenda/ \
                    --with-cgibindir=/www/cgi-bin/cdsagenda/ \
                    --with-utildir=/usr/local/bin/cdsagenda/ \
                    --with-htdocsurl=http://webserver.domain.com/cdsagenda/ \
                    --with-cgibinurl=http://webserver.domain.com/cgi-bin/cdsagenda/ \
                    --with-dbhost=sqlserver.domain.com \
                    --with-dbname=cdsagenda \
                    --with-dbuser=cdsagenda \
                    --with-dbpass=myp1ss  \
                    --with-dbhostport=3456

          Configure essential  parameters, as the installation
          directories for HTDOCS files, CGI scripts and DB utilities,
          the URL of the homepage and CGI scripts, and database host,
          database name, and database user credentials.
          
          The first two directories must be within the Apache's htdocs
          and cgi-bin paths.  The DB utilities may be installed
          anywhere on the system.  Note that CDS Agenda won't install in any
          other directories but the three mentioned in the above
          configure line.

          If the --with-dbhostport is not used, the default value (3306) 
          will be applied.

          This configuration step is mandatory.  

      $ gmake install

          Install the web pages, cgi scripts and database utilities
          in the respective directories, as specified earlier by the
          configure command.

          After this step, you should be able to point your browser to
          the chosen URL of your local  installation and see it
          running!

      $ gmake create-tables     ## optional

          Optionally, create  tables on the MySQL server.  You
          probably want to do this step only once, i.e. only if you
          have not created any  databases yet.

      $ vi /www/data/cdsagenda/config/config_runtime.inc

          Optionally, customize your  installation.  Unlike the
          installation directories and other essential parameters that
          were defined in the previous step, the "config_runtime.inc" file
          enables you to change the way the software will behave.
	  In particular you should set the admin_email and superuser_email
	  variables inside this file to your email address to be considered
 	  as administrator by the system.
          This configuration step is optional, but strongly
          recommended.

      $ netscape http://webserver.domain.com/cdsagenda/manager ## optional

          Optionally, do further runtime configuration of the CDS Agenda,
          like definition of the hierarchy tree, etc. 
	  You will be able to access these pages ONLY IF you filled the
          superuser_email variable (see above), and logged in using this
	  same email address.


Good luck, and thanks for choosing the CDS Agenda Software.
