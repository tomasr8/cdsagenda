Notes: 
	* This version includes a built-in module dedicated to authentication
	  (login + groups management)
	* Make sure you put your email address in the $admin_email variable
	  in config/config_runtime.inc file to have access to all management
 	  interfaces when logged in.
	* However, you also have the possibility to use a local IMAP server for
	  login, and/or a local LDAP server for group managements. In this 
	  case, please edit the platform/authentication/ldapfunctions.inc and
	  imapfunctions.inc files for your local implementation. All functions
	  implemented in these scripts are very CERN-centric.
	* IN ANY CASE, to run this new version, MySQL should be compiled with
	  --with-imap and --with-ldap
