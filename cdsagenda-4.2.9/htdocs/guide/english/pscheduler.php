        <LI>CDS Agenda offers you the opportunity to export data from an agenda into you personal schedular program (korganizer, evolution, outlook...).<br>
        <LI>When you see this icon <img src=<? print ${IMAGES_WWW};?>/note.gif width=20 height=20 border=0>, simply click on it, and if your browser is well configured, the data will automatically be exported to your scheduler tool.<br>
        <LI>If the export does not work, perhaps your browser is not correctly configured, or the scheduler does not support batch import. In this case, right-click on the icon, then choose "Save link as" to save the calendar on your local computer. Then use the import facility of your scheduler to import the file.<br>
        <LI>The data is exported in the vCalendar format which is supposed to be supported by most personal scheduler programs.
