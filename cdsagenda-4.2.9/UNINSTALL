==================================================

      $ cd /usr/local/src/eagenda-0.9
      $ gmake uninstall     ## NOTE: This has not been tested yet!!
      $ cd ..
      $ rm -rf eagenda-0.9.tar.gz eagenda-0.9
      $ mysql -h sqlserver.domain.com -u root -p mysql
          mysql> DROP DATABASE cdsagenda;
          mysql> REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON cdsagenda.* FROM cdsagenda@webserver.domain.com;

2. Detailed instructions for the patient CDS Agenda admin
===================================================

      $ cd /usr/local/src/eagenda-0.9
 
          Change to the directory where you have configured and built
          the CDS Software.

      $ gmake uninstall     ## NOTE: This has not been tested yet!!

          This will uninstall all the installed web pages, cgi scripts
          and database utilities from their respective directories.

          Note that it may happen that you will need to clean manually
          HTDOCS directory where all the collection pages were
          created.  We'll test this in the coming future.

          Also, you may want to remove the directories manually in
          case you have added some non-CDS Agenda files to the same place.

      $ cd ..
  
          Go to the parent directory.

      $ rm -rf eagenda-0.9.tar.gz eagenda-0.9

          Wipe out the downloaded tarball and all the CDS Agenda sources.

      $ mysql -h sqlserver.domain.com -u root -p mysql
          mysql> DROP DATABASE cdsagenda;
          mysql> REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON cdsagenda.* FROM cdsagenda@webserver.domain.com;

          Ask your MySQL administrator to execute the above commands
          that will drop the CDS Agenda databases and revoke access rights
          to the CDSware user.

Good luck, and thanks for testing the CDS Agenda Software.
We would be glad to hear from you on your CDS Agenda experience: please tell
us what you think and thus help us to improve the system.  Thanks!
